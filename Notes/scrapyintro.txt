Creating a Scrapy project :

	$ scrapy startproject projectName
	
	
Spiders:

	Spiders are classes that we define that Scrapy uses to scrape info.
	
	They are subclass of Spider.
	
	Define intial requests to make
	how to follow links and how to parse the downloaded page to extract data.
	

	some attributes and methods of spider:
		
		name : identifies the spider and must be unique within a project.
		
		start_request():
			return an iterable of Requests (a list or request or write a generator function) which spider will start crawling from.
			
			Subsequent requests will be generated successibely from these initial requests
			
	parse(): method to handle the response downloaded for each of the requests made.
	usually parses the response and finding new URLs to follow
	
	
Requests and Response :

	Scrapy uses Request and response objects for crawling web.
	
	Typically generated in spiders and passed till they reach Downloader which executes the request and reutrns a Response object.
	
	Both have subclasses
		
		Request :
	
		A request object represents an HTTP request .
	
		scrapy.Request(*args)
		
			parameters:
				url(str): URL of this request
					if invalid then a ValueError is raised.
				
				callback(callable) :Fuction will be called with the response of this request as it's first parameter.
					  
					  Defualt value : parse function
				
	
		
	
	


	response: Holds the page content 
		instance of TextResponse
